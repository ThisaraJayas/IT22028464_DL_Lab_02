
1)

Small number of nodes (1–3) The network cannot capture complex patterns in the data.

Result: low accuracy, underfitting.


Medium number of nodes (4–5) The network has enough capacity to learn the main patterns.

Result: optimal accuracy (90% in your planar dataset example).


Large number of nodes (20–50) The network can capture more patterns, but many nodes become redundant.

Result: slightly higher or similar accuracy, but risk of overfitting increases if dataset is small.



2)
Underfitting at low node counts, accuracy is low because the network is too simple.

Accuracy rises with moderate node counts, network can learn patterns well, so accuracy peaks.

Plateau or slight improvement at high node counts, adding more nodes doesn’t improve much; may even overfit if the dataset is small or noisy.
